\title{graphon : a Collection of Graphon Estimation Methods}
\description{
The \pkg{graphon} provides a not-so-comprehensive list of methods for estimating graphon,
a symmetric measurable function, from a single or multiple of observed networks.
It also contains several auxiliary functions for generating sample networks using
various network models and graphons.
}
\section{What is Graphon?}{

Graphon - graph function - is a symmetric measurable function \deqn{W:[0,1]^2\rightarrow[0,1]} that arise
in studying exchangeable random graph models as well as sequence of dense graphs. In the language of
graph theory, it can be understood as a two-stage procedural network modeling that 1) each vertex/node in the graph
is assigned an independent random variable \eqn{u_j} from uniform distribution \eqn{U[0,1]}, and
2) each edge \eqn{(i,j)} is randomly determined with probability \eqn{W(u_i,u_j)}. Due to such
procedural aspect, the term \emph{probability matrix} and \emph{graphon} will be interchangeably used
in further documentation.
}

\section{Composition of the package}{

The package mainly consists of two types of functions whose names start with \code{'est'}
and \code{'gmodel'} for estimation algorithms and graph models, respectively.

The \code{'est'} family has 4 estimation methods at the current version,
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{est.LG}} for empirical degree sorting in stochastic blockmodel.
  \item \code{\link{est.SBA}} for stochastic blockmodel approximation.
  \item \code{\link{est.USVT}} for universal singular value thresholding.
  \item \code{\link{est.nbdsmooth}} for neighborhood smoothing.
  \item \code{\link{est.completion}} for matrix completion from a partially revealed data.
}

Also, the current release has following graph models implemented,
\itemize{
  \item \code{\link{gmodel.P}} generates a binary graph given an arbitrary probability matrix.
  \item \code{\link{gmodel.ER}} is an implementation of Erdos-Renyi random graph models.
  \item \code{\link{gmodel.block}} is used to generate networks with block structure.
  \item \code{\link{gmodel.preset}} has 10 exemplary graphon models for simulation.
