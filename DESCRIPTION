Description: Provides a not-so-comprehensive list of methods for estimating graphon,
    a symmetric measurable function, from a single or multiple of observed networks. 
    For a detailed introduction on graphon and popular estimation techniques, 
    see the paper by Orbanz, P. and Roy, D.M.(2014) <doi:10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2334607>.
    It also contains several auxiliary functions for generating sample networks
    using various network models and graphons.
